Subject: [PATCH] revision cache: maps of 'new' objects

When making a pack, it is useful to know if an object is already
reachable from any of the objects that the receiving party is known to
have; it allows the object to be excluded from the pack.  Allow
optional bitmaps for 'start' objects which permit storage of this
information.
