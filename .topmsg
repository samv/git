Subject: [PATCH] [WIP] revision cache: allow foreign 'start' commits

Usually the 'start' commits are always 'interesting' commits in a
revision query, however with the 'newness' bitmaps we can also use
them to mask out objects, ie 'uninteresting' commits.  An index which
was useless, due to an unknown object existing in the 'uninteresting'
commit list can be converted to a useful one by building the bitmap of
'reachable' and 'new' objects for that commit - without having to
insert new objects in the middle of the list, which would require
rebuilding the entire index.  So, there is a use case for storing
information on 'start' objects which aren't actually in the object
list.  Permit this case.

This is currently a work in progress; extension to how this affects
the use cases is not there yet.
