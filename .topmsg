Subject: Shift rev-list enumeration from upload-pack to pack-objects
    
instead of using the internal revision walker and piping object refs
to pack-objects this patch passes only the revs to pack-objects, which
in turn handles both enumeration and packing.  does not handle shallow
objects, and frankly I'm not uber confident about it anyway.  works
though.

+

fixed shallow/thin-pack support in upload-pack (needs work though?)
