Subject: daemon-cache: caching layer between upload-pack and pack-objects

The concept is that certain fetches will be really common
(obvious: clone, but also between major releases, eg.), something we
could exploit by caching packfiles of those requests and serving them
directly from disk.

git's structure makes this very easy as we can just route pipes
between upload-pack and pack-objects through daemon-cache.
interestingly, in it's currently implementation it would make full
clone restarts a very real possibility, even after commits.
